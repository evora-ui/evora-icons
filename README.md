The project is open source and framework‑friendly.

- Source SVGs live in `svgs/`
- Attribution for some icons is provided via `NOTICE`

- React (soon): `@evora/icons-react` is on the roadmap

## Source & Contributions
- SVG sources are kept in this repository under `svgs/`
- Contributions (new icons, improvements, fixes) are welcome via pull requests

## Roadmap
- `@evora/icons-react`: React package with tree‑shakable per‑icon imports (coming soon)
